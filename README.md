## What is DDoS Attack?

<i>
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack attempts to make an online service or a website unavailable by overloading it with vast floods of internet traffic generated from multiple sources. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices.
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack, in which one computer and one Internet connection are used to flood a targeted resource with packets, but a DDoS attack uses many computers and many Internet connections, often distributed globally in what is referred to as aÂ botnet.
A large-scale volumetric DDoS attack can generate traffic measured in tens of Gigabits (and even hundreds of Gigabits) per second. A regular network will not be able to handle such traffic. Attackers build a network of hacked machines known as botnets by spreading malicious code through emails, websites, and social media. Once these computers are infected, they can be controlled remotely, without their owners' knowledge, and used as an army to launch an attack against any target.</i>
